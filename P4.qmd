## Elevator pitch
Throughout this project, we will explore Machine Learning by closely examining specific datasets and analyzing the information they provide. Using the principles learned, we will apply data analysis techniques and create visualizations to better understand the insights within the data. Our focus will be on housing data in Colorado, comparing trends before and after 1980.

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and `before1980`.__ Explain what you learn from the charts The following three charts correspond to our dataset and provide relevant comparisons based on the available information. Below are the charts along with their descriptions.

```{python}


#%%
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import altair as alt
#%%
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn import metrics
# %%
dwellings_denver = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/dat
dwellings_ml = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/data-ra
dwellings_neighborhoods_ml = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/
#%%

This chart compares homes built before and after 1980 based on whether or not they have a basement and more than one story. This information tells us what kinds of living spaces were allocated over time. Older houses had fewer stories but often included a basement. New houses have more than one story, though they are less likely to have a basement.
#Query/Chart 1
que_1 = dwellings_ml.filter(["livearea", "finbsmnt", "before1980"]).sample(500)
sns.pairplot(que_1, hue = "before1980")
#%%

This second chart reveals some interesting insights. First, it shows that newer houses tend to have less living area compared to those built before 1980. Additionally, the data indicates that older houses were more likely to have finished basements than newer ones. These two factors provide valuable insights into how living conditions and home design have changed over time.

#Query/Chart 2
que_2 = dwellings_ml.filter(["stories", "basement", "before1980"]).sample(500)
sns.pairplot(que_2, hue = "before1980")
#%%

In this third chart, we compare the living area of houses built before and after 1980 in relation to the number of bedrooms. The data shows that older houses generally had more bedrooms, though their total living space was only slightly larger than that of newer homes. In contrast, newer houses tend to have fewer bedrooms and, in most cases, less overall living area compared to older homes.
#Query/Chart 3
que_3 = dwellings_ml.filter(["numbdrm", "livearea", "before1980"]).sample(500)
sns.pairplot(que_3, hue = "before1980")

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”.__ Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.  

During this part of the project, I analyzed the differences between various classification models, but I did not find any significant variations apart from differences in accuracy. In the end, I chose to use the RandomForestClassifier, which achieved an accuracy of 92%, indicating that it is highly precise and reliable.

```{python}
#%%
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import altair as alt
# %%
dwellings_denver = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/dat
dwellings_ml = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/data-ra
dwellings_neighborhoods_ml = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/
#%%
X_pred = dwellings_ml.drop(['before1980', 'yrbuilt', 'parcel'], axis=1)
y_pred = dwellings_ml.filter(["before1980"], axis = 1)
# Use of models...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
X_pred,
y_pred,
test_size = .34,
random_state = 76)
#%%
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=1)
clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


```


## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model.__ This discussion should include a feature importance chart and a description of the features. 

By using the RandomForestClassifier, we achieve a high level of accuracy in classification. The following table displays the True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance. These numbers help demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the model in making accurate predictions.

```{python}
#%%
#question 3
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=1)
clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
metrics.plot_confusion_matrix(clf, X_test, y_test)


```


## QUESTION|TASK 4

__Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics.__ You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.  

I decided that the two main evaluation metrics for this project specifically and that can better desccribe
the Classification Model are: Accuracy and Recall. And i further identify each of them as factors of the
model and its viability on the project.


```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=1)
clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

```
